        <h1>React a JavaScript Framework</h1>
        <p>React is a widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a powerful and efficient
            way to create interactive web applications. React follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is
            divided into reusable and modular components. Each component can have its own state, which allows for
            efficient updates and rendering only the necessary parts of the UI. React uses a virtual DOM (Document
            Object Model) that efficiently updates and reconciles the actual DOM, resulting in faster and smoother UI
            updates. It also allows developers to write components using JSX, a syntax extension that combines HTML-like
            syntax with JavaScript. React's popularity is due to its simplicity, reusability, and performance, making it
            a go-to choice for developers building modern web applications.</p>
